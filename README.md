# Pour-Grocery-Mobile-Application

## App Description
Pour Grocery is a mobile application developed for the Android platform using React Native. The app provides a seamless grocery delivery service in Malaysia, prioritizing convenience and quality for its users.

## Tools, Platforms, and Frameworks Used
- **Visual Studio Code:** Source code editor used on desktop.
- **Node.js:** A cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **SQLite3:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) contained in a C library, use directly with the end program.
- **Postman:** An API client used for creating and testing API connections with database.
- **Flask:** An application framework used to create and transfer HTML or other markup languages between the web server and application via HTTP requests.

## Pages Included

- **User Side:**
  - **Authentication:** `LoginScreen.js`, `RegisterScreen.js`
  - **Shopping:** `Home.js`, `Product.js`, `Cart.js`, `Payment.js`
  - **Profile Management:** `Account.js`, `EditAccount.js`

- **Admin Side:**
  - **Product Management:** `AProduct.js`, `ACategory.js`
  - **Admin Profile Management:** `Account.js`, `EditAccount.js`

- **Common UI Elements - Shared components:**
  - **Custom_Pay.js:** `CheckButton`, `FeeDisplay` - used across multiple pages for payment and authentication.
  - **Custom_Product.js:** Used in `Product.js` for product listing and details.
  - **GlobalStyle.js:** Global styling applied across various pages.
  - **Colors.js:** Common color themes used throughout the app.

## Data Persistence

The web server is configured to handle three primary tables and stored in the application, includes:

- **Grocery**: Used in the Home and AProduct pages.
- **Category**: Used in the Home and ACategory pages.
- **User**: Used in the Account, EditAccount, Login, and Register pages.

`State variables` are employed to manage the application's data dynamically. When the user accesses the home page, these variables are initialized (often set to null or empty). After fetching data from `SQLite`, the state variables capture this data to render it on the app's screen.

## App Connectivity to Cloud

`Flask` web-based API is implemented to manage data on a web server, allowing our app to interact with the server over the internet via HTTP. This API manipulates the data stored in the SQLite database. Flask, a Python framework, was set up for our web service program, and we used Postman to test and validate the API connection before integrating it into our application.


## Demo Output

### User Side

1. **Login and Register**
   
   - This is the initial screen where users can log in with their email and password. Fields are validated to ensure they are not empty, and users receive error messages if credentials are incorrect or if the user does not exist in the database.  New users can register by providing their name, email, address, and password. The system checks for required fields, displaying error messages for invalid inputs. Upon successful registration, users are redirected to the login page.
